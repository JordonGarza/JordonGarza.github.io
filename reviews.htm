A continuation of the original series, this title involves Kratos taking his son Atreus to the tallest peak in order to spread their mother&rsquo;s ashes. Of course, this is all with the fact that Kratos is the Greek god of war, the two are in Midgard of Norse mythology, and Wikipedia states this is an </span><span class="c3">Action</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Adventure game. So rather than expecting a calm walk with a stop at your local Chili&rsquo;s like I do with my funeral processions, one should prepare for a thrilling journey with monsters and gods blocking the way to fulfilling your ultimate goal. </span><span class="c0 c4">God of War</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is the </span><span class="c0 c4">Odyssey</span><span class="c5 c0">&nbsp;of Action Adventure games, and I mean this in multiple positive and negative ways that I will unpack throughout this review. So please, take my hand and let us begin by starting at the necessary background information.</span></p><p class="c4 c6 c9"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0">I experienced and beat this game (on the equivalent of hard) as a general Playstation fan. I have beaten the original PS2 </span><span class="c0 c1">God of War</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;through a PS3 remaster and watched maybe one or two story summaries of the rest of the games. As a result, I am immediately more versed in the story and context of this sequel than 95% of the playerbase. All joking aside, this game is very much the first game in a sequel series. There are some passive references in the beginning, which may incorrectly make fans assume this is a reboot or some reimagining, but explicit elements and story beats introduce themselves confirming that this is a true sequel. The general synopsis of this game is this: Kratos, the Greek god of war, escapes to the Norse land of Midgard after murdering pretty much every god in Greek mythology and dooming the world to eternal chaos and disorder. If it sounds like that should affect the land of Midgard, congratulations, you noticed something that is never addressed in </span><span class="c0 c1">God of War</span><span class="c3 c0">. Continuing the synopsis, and where this game begins, years have passed since the unexplained escape to Midgard and Kratos has had a child with a woman that he assumedly married. The player controls Kratos as he gathers wood to cremate the mother, and through extreme circumstances, Kratos is forced to begin his journey of taking Atreus to fulfill his mother&rsquo;s dying wish: to have her ashes spread at the tallest peak.</span></p><p class="c4 c6 c9"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0">The resulting journey of trying to fulfill the mother&rsquo;s wish is the entire game, and this journey alone is the first parallel to the </span><span class="c0 c1">Odyssey </span><span class="c0">due to it playing out like an epic, and it is epic (sorry). Sprawling across multiple realms from snow peaked mountains, to overgrown ruins retaken by nature, to the depths of the icy and barren afterlife realm of Hel, </span><span class="c0 c1">God of War</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;takes you to a good variety of locations and levels. The visual design is top-notch, and praise must be given for the creativity and beauty of many of the locations such as a witch&rsquo;s house that is a giant tortoise, or the main hub area which is permanently occupied by the World Serpent, a colossus of a being that actually can drain the lake surrounding the hub area, opening more areas for exploration. All of these locations on an artistic level are gorgeous, where the level design varies. Not much for immersion, I never really care how levels are designed because most of the time I recognize I am playing a video game and cannot really be taken out of that experience. So many of the nitpicks like Kratos not being able to climb a cliff or set of planks despite him being capable of that prowess, never really affected my experience.</span></p><p class="c4 c6 c9"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing the notion of this game playing out like an epic, I appreciate the story essentially being an actual epic with some subversions. As Kratos tries to teach Atreus throughout the journey, we see in Kratos through dialogue that he is the Spartan ideal. Discipline, control, and effectiveness are the main traits that Kratos tries to pass on to Boy-tos, and is done with about as much grace as having a Spartan warrior be your father trying to teach you lessons. Kratos&rsquo; stories to teach Atreus are essentially blunt demands to be disciplined, and Kratos scolds him continuously for disobeying orders as if Atreus was under his command rather than his son. In this we see a subversion to the epic in that Kratos&rsquo; Spartan side is critiqued rather than celebrated by showing how uneffective he can be at attempting to raise Atreus into someone better than his father. Similar to an epic structure, our hero&rsquo;s journey involves running face to face with larger than life figures such as monsters and gods. These interactions with monsters and gods is the backdrop for all of the character interactions as well as the combat and boss fights. Pulling from Norse mythology, pretty much every character that Kratos and Atreus meet along the way feel realized as full pieces to this epic of Kratos&rsquo; journey. Even if all of the characters may not feel as complete human beings, they more than serve their clear purpose as characters that act to teach the player the lesson about the overall theme of </span><span class="c0 c1">God of War</span><span class="c0">, family. With feuding brothers, sons of asshole gods, parricide, and more, it is clear that all of the characters of the video game serve to complement and parallel with Kratos and Atreus&rsquo; own relationship and they do so effectively. This leads to the next point of praise for this game, the good of the gameplay of </span><span class="c0 c1">God of War</span><span class="c3 c0">.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best parts of the gameplay of </span><span class="c0 c1">God of War</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to me, were all aspects that purposely fed into strengthening and affirming the story of the game. The side quests and activities are some of the best I have played through in an Action Adventure title, because they greatly enhance the story by providing actual reasons for Kratos and Atreus to bond and learn from one another. Going from the parricide I mentioned, one sidequest involves a bandit whose son literally backstabbed them. By doing the quest, Atreus, appalled, asks Kratos how anyone could possibly kill their father. As this question is asked Kratos might as well Jim-face to the camera with a laugh track, as he is responsible for the murder of his brother, father, and basically anyone else that would be considered to be invited at a Thanksgiving dinner. These side quest interactions enhance the relationship of Kratos and Atreus to me, and I was excited to do more side quests because I knew it would lead to further discussion and bonding. To the pure gameplay side of things, the primary focuses of this game is combat and exploration. Combat feels great with a serviceable variety of moves that allows for some decent combos, and later in the game you unlock runic attacks and summons which allow for more customization and flashy hits onto enemies. You can also command Atreus to fire arrows upon a target foe, doing some small but noticeable damage and distracting them for you to take full advantage. The boss fights of the game are the highlight of levels, with the best gameplay moments of the game coming from two specific bosses and an end-game raid boss sort of enemy. These boss fights show how the combat shine, primarily by showing how the combat system encourages a reactive mindset of dodge, attack and then punish with the appropriate attacks of your own. The best fights in the game followed this to the T, with you going into a hypnotic rhythm of defense and attack that felt like you were beating an enemy with your pure skill and wits. The exploration is mainly carried by the level design, but regardless exploring the world feels fine if gamey at times. Again, many of the areas feel clearly like levels instead of actual areas to be immersed in, but regardless it is fun to jump around and collect health upgrades and more. There are light puzzles that require quick usage of Kratos&rsquo; ability to throw and recall his axe like Thor&rsquo;s hammer, or require you to find objects in the world similar to I-spy to then break with the axe. All of the puzzles were fine, with none really being too difficult but also none being all that engaging either. And it is here that I begin telling you why </span><span class="c0 c1">God of War</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;is bad at times for being like the most famous epic in history.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The </span><span class="c0 c1">Odyssey</span><span class="c0">, one of the standout and arguably biggest pieces of literature to ever come from Western civilization, exists as a collection of the aspects of Western civilization from the time period. Not only was the good immortalized like the morals and ideals of Greek civilization, but also the hard times such as the war and suffering brought upon by conflict. Similar to </span><span class="c0 c1">God of War</span><span class="c0">, this epic attempts to be a collection of the aspects of modern video games as a collective medium, but boy does it bring upon a little suffering sometimes. One element is the overall take-it-or-leave-it puzzle elements of the game. The other is random RPG elements such as a full gear and leveling system that has no reason to be there. Throughout the game, Kratos can equip himself with a variety of trinkets, chest plates, fanny packs and more to provide stat boosts to specific things such as less damage when hit, or lower cooldowns on the special runic attacks and summons. Ultimately I could not really figure out any noticeable difference, but that could be due to me not grinding for the higher mid to end-game level armor sets that had higher numbers. On top of this it also attempts to be a spectacle fighter and also a story-driven game, and it is clear that Santa Monica Studio cast an extremely wide net for gamers to get into this new series. As a result of this overextension in mechanics however is the feeling that some of these feel a little underdeveloped to flat-out inferior to other games that do that specific element right. If </span><span class="c0 c1">God of War</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was simply a brawler that told an engaging focused plot, I feel that it would have much more in the combat department and be better for it. But instead we have </span><span class="c0 c1">God of War</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;the Action Adventure title with puzzle elements and RPG loot system and a daily crossword to do and you can see where I am going with this. For how much the game mechanics are a little all over the place with half-ass justifications, the story sadly can fall into the same trap at times.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest negative I can give the </span><span class="c0 c1">Odyssey</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and likewise </span><span class="c0 c1">God of War</span><span class="c0">, is it having a lot of setbacks in the plot for dumb shit reasons. In the </span><span class="c0 c1">Odyssey</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;there is a critical part where a cyclops throws half a mountain at Odysseus and prays to Poseidon to stop Odysseus. As a result, it turns out that Odysseus&rsquo; journey is greatly set back for a very very long time just when he was about to successfully sail home. My great ancestor replied to that moment with &ldquo;fucking really?&rdquo;, as recorded in an ancient tablet that was a review for the </span><span class="c0 c1">Odyssey</span><span class="c0">. Likewise, there are so many moments in the plot of this game where you think you are going to continue but no, you actually require another item to get through this setback. The first actual example is when approaching a mountain peak that is shrouded in black mist, it is revealed that you must get some magic artifact from another realm to dispel the deadly mist. And then you walk all the back to the mountain to then slowly dispel the mist. It only gets worse and more convoluted. Kratos needs another artifact to travel to a specific realm, Kratos brought his citizenship application but turns out he needs to drive back for proof of his spouse&rsquo;s employment abroad cause he&rsquo;s applying under U.S. 319 B. It honestly happened so many times, that I was legitimately concern that </span><span class="c0 c1">If You Give A Mouse A Cookie</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;was an inspiration for the plot of this video game. Do not get me wrong, when actual plot happens and progression moves the game and locations forward, the game is gripping and engaging. However it cannot be overlooked that this setback trend takes a considerable amount of the playtime. The last third of the game luckily has only one major setback scene, with the rest being plot that moves forward greatly, and it gripped me so much that I stayed up hours into the middle of the night to finish pretty much the entire last third of the game.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, despite the negatives in the all-over-the-place nature of the game mechanics, the core combat remains solid and leads to some amazing boss fights and enemy encounters. There is a minor gripe I have with enemies being repeated a bit much and also some boss enemies repeating in the story missions more than I had hoped. Do not take the boss complaint as I wish there was not those specific boss enemies (trolls), but rather that they filled the role of end-level boss when I expected something more or unique. The worst offender is the depths of Hel, the underworld of Norse mythology, is said to be guarded by a fearsome foe. Going deeper and deeper I was so excited, wondering what could that enemy could be. Turns out it was another troll boss enemy, albeit with some different moves. It was a bit underwhelming to say the least and killed the motion the journey through Hel was providing. </span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the story and gameplay encounters are not repeating the same beats though, it is a blast to play with a story that I loved. Like I said earlier, the final third of the game is very engaging both in introducing new gameplay elements fast but not overstaying their welcome, and with story events that bring Kratos and Atreus closer to understanding themselves and the unfamiliar land they are in as they attempt to fulfill the mother&rsquo;s wish. Earlier I mentioned that the best part of </span><span class="c0 c1">God of War </span><span class="c3 c0">was the gameplay that complemented the story, and that is taken to its fullest potential by letting the mechanics tell the story. Many emotions and actions in the story are made infinitely more deep and impactful with the fact that the game mechanics complement these emotions. I will not spoil any of them, but many sullen moments are paired with a reflection of no combat, and highlight scenes of power and strength are complemented with letting you have the opportunity to wreck as Kratos. Allowing you to feel the tone and mood without arresting control from you is unique to video gaming and Santa Monica Studio uses these to create my absolute favorite moments in the entire game.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, </span><span class="c0 c1">God of War</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is similar to the epic of Homer. Sprawling many locations with many legendary creatures and characters to meet, befriend, or kill, </span><span class="c0 c1">God of War</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;incorporates many elements from modern video gaming to which it does not nail the landing on all of those said elements. Similar to the epic, </span><span class="c0 c1">God of War</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;also features a story with a few too many setbacks and distractions from the grandiose tale it attempts to present. However, when the story advances in plot without this setback problem, and the combat is allowed to shine through being a blast to unlock new moves to beat down on legendary bosses, </span><span class="c0 c1">God of War</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;becomes nigh impossible to set down for a break and I was completely enthralled by the time I got to the ending revelations and conflicts resolving. Like the </span><span class="c0 c1">Odyssey</span><span class="c0">, even if there are some flaws, it remains an essential hallmark with much more going right than wrong. There is much set up for a sequel series, and I feel that with improvements to the story being more forward motion rather than back and forth, and more options are given for combat such as the possibility of jumping and aerial combat, the sequel to </span><span class="c0 c1">God of War</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;could very well be a game of the year winner and a game to join the rank of system seller. As of right now, this game still remains to be a game of the year contender for me, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the broad Action Adventure/Story Driven genre and to anyone with a PS4 who seems interested at all.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></body>
